# artifacts-data-analysis

Data analysis of museum artifacts using SQL and Python.

This project analyzes museum artifact data using SQL and Python to extract insights on artifact metadata, colors, and media.

## Features
- Complex SQL joins and aggregations
- Python scripts for API data fetching and processing
- Data insights by culture, period, and classification

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:https://github.com/tamilarasirajendran/artifacts-data-analysis.git
2. Install required Python packages: pip install sqlalchemy 

## Usage
- Make sure you have setup TiDB/MySQL with artifact data tables
- Run Python scripts to fetch and analyze data
- Review outputs in the scripts or exported files

## Challenges
- Handling missing or inconsistent data
- TiDB syntax differences from MySQL
- Combining multiple tables for analysis

## Future Work
- Automate reporting dashboards
- Include image analysis and visualization
- Expand API integration
